                <h1>Design of a Radiation-Hardened Optical Transceiver</h1>
                <p>
                    This project is my undergraduate thesis and involves the design and testing of a radiation-hardened
                    transceiver fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process. The first generation device is targeting a data rate of
                    500 Mbps and the second generation is targeting a data rate of 6.25 Gbps. I have been specifically assisting
                    with the electrical and radiation measurements and will contribute to the design and layout of the second
                    generation device as I work on my thesis.
                </p>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Reliable and efficient communication links are vital in harsh environments where ionizing
                    radiation is present. Optical links specifically are necessary to support the growing need
                    for higher data rates and faster signal processing requirements of devices in these
                    environments. For many years, radiation hardness in electronics has been achieved via
                    specialized manufacturing processes by dedicated foundries. These techniques have
                    failed to scale at the rate of commercial CMOS processes, disallowing for faster and more
                    efficient circuits. One strategy to create radiation tolerant circuits while still using
                    commercial fabrication is to use a hard-by-design methodology. This research seeks to
                    utilize this approach to design an optical transceiver based on a transmit vertical-cavity
                    surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and a receive photo-detector (PD) with a radiation
                    hardened transceiver circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>Topology</h2>
                <p>The device can overall be divided into three parts: the transmit circuitry, the receive
                    circuitry, and the scan chain. Each part will be discussed in detail below. A high level
                    overview of the device is shown below.
                </p>
                <img src="img/radhard.png" height="350px" width="340px">
                <p>On the transmit side, a LVDS buffer receives the incoming data and converts it to a current-
                    mode logic (CML) signal. The output of the buffer is passed through a CML to CMOS
                    converter including triple modular redundancy (TMR) for radiation hardness. From here, the
                    output VCSEL is driven with a user controlled modulation and bias current. The driver
                    currents are biased with a current-mode band gap reference for radiation hardness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the receive side, a DC-coupled photo-detector delivers the current mode signal to the
                    device. A transimpedance amplifier (TIA) amplifies the signal and converts it to a voltage
                    swing. The amplifier’s primary current source is biased with a current-mode band gap
                    reference for radiation hardness. From here, the differential signal is passed through DC
                    offset compensation circuitry and a post amplification stage. Next, a level shifter converts
                    1.8V signaling to 3.3V. The block includes TMR for radiation hardness. Finally, the shifted
                    signal is converted and driven into a LVDS electrical output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scan chain includes control circuitry for selection of TX modulation current (8-bits), TX
                    bias current (8-bits), and one reset bit. Each control line will include TMR for radiation
                    hardness.
                </p>
                <h2>Radiation Hardening Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    Various techniques will be used in the design and layout of the device to ensure it is hard to
                    both SEEs and TID effects. The three primary hard-by-design practices that will be used are
                    an enclosed layout technique, triple modular redundancy, and the use of a band gap
                    reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An enclosed layout technique (shown below) is used to eliminate the source to drain leakage
                    path caused by TID radiation. This design provides radiation hardness at the cost of
                    increased area, increased device capacitance, and thus decreased speed.

                    Triple modular redundancy (TMR) involves creating three copies of a certain circuit, usually
                    digital control or some module with latching elements, and performing a “vote” on the output
                    to ensure the signals are identical and a single event upset (SEU) has not occurred. If the
                    three outputs are not identical, the bit will be thrown out. The use of TMR is intended to
                    counter SEUs on latching elements, that is, when a particle strikes a latch or flip-flop and
                    causes the bit to reverse. Since the probability of three SEUs simultaneously is extremely
                    unlikely, TMR is effective at eliminating these effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the use of a current-mode band gap reference will provide a
                    bias point for the VCSEL driver and TIA. The circuit produces a stable current reference
                    regardless of temperature and radiation dose.
