				<h1>Multistage Amplifier</h1>
				<p>For the final project in my <i>Electronics</i> course, we were tasked with designing a multistage amplifier that could meet various specifications, 
				and, eventually, amplify audio from our computers.  The load that had to be driven was quite small, around 8 Ohms.  Our goal was to provide 30dB of gain
				with low distortion on the output.  My team opted to go for a 2-stage approach, with a gain stage and a buffer stage.</p>
				<p>We started the design by using two BJT configurations, the common-emitter for the gain stage, and the common-base for the buffer stage.
					With this approach however, we found it quite difficult to obtain desirable results, mainly because of difficulties matching the impedances of the
					two stages with BJTs.  Both stages worked quite well on their own, but when combined did not.
				</p>
				<p>To overcome this challenge, we shifted our design approach to use a NMOS based common-drain configuration for the buffer stage.  Doing this allowed
					much simpler impedance matching and enabled us to design this stage with the output impedance of the first stage in mind.  After making this change,
					we were able to complete the project and meet the design specifications given.
				</p>
