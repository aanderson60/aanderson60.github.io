                <h1>A 2.4-GHz Direct-Conversion Merged LNA-Mixer and QVCO in 90nm CMOS</h1>
                <p>
                    This project, from the RFIC course at Texas A&M, presents the design and simulation of a 2.4GHz direct-conversion receiver frontend implemented in 
                    90nm CMOS technology. The design features a fully differential merged LNA-mixer and a quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO), 
                    optimized for low power consumption and high integration efficiency in modern wireless systems.
                </p>

                <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
                <p>
                    In radio frequency (RF) receiver design, several architectures are commonly used — including heterodyne, image-reject, and direct-conversion types. 
                    The direct-conversion receiver (also known as zero-IF) eliminates intermediate frequency (IF) stages by downconverting 
                    the input RF signal directly to baseband:
                </p>
                <p id="equation">f<sub>IF</sub> = f<sub>LO</sub> − f<sub>RF</sub></p>
                <p>
                    Since <em>f<sub>LO</sub></em> is nearly equal to <em>f<sub>RF</sub></em>, the IF lies close to DC, enabling the use of low-pass filters 
                    instead of bulky off-chip bandpass filters. This enhances integration and simplifies the overall receiver chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A critical requirement for direct-conversion systems is >quadrature local oscillator (LO) generation — providing I and Q 
                    signals 90° apart to support complex demodulation and mitigate self-mixing effects. This project achieves that using a low-power 
                    Quadrature VCO (QVCO) with anti-phase coupling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power efficiency is further improved through the use of a merged LNA–mixer architecture, in which the current generated 
                    by the low-noise amplifier (LNA) directly feeds the mixer’s transconductance stage. While this approach minimizes power and area, it 
                    introduces a tradeoff with linearity, as the reduced headroom limits the achievable IIP3.
                </p>
                <h2>Topology and Design Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend employs a merged LNA-mixer topology where the low-noise amplifier and mixer share current flow, 
                    significantly improving power efficiency. The LNA uses a cascode common-source configuration with inductive 
                    source and gate degeneration for input matching, while the mixer is based on a Gilbert cell quadrature structure
                    to support direct-conversion architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quadrature VCO (QVCO) with anti-phase coupling provides the required local oscillator signals, achieving 
                    low phase noise and wide tuning range. All inductors were EM-simulated and optimized for quality factor and resonance frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>Achieved Results</h2>
                <p>
                    The proposed receiver demonstrates strong performance compared to similar architectures, achieving 
                    high conversion gain and competitive noise figure while maintaining low power operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 2.4GHz direct-conversion receiver successfully integrates the LNA, mixer, and QVCO into a compact, low-power design suitable for 
                    applications such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other ISM-band communication systems. The merged architecture demonstrates the 
                    feasibility of achieving excellent performance metrics within the power and voltage constraints of advanced CMOS processes.
